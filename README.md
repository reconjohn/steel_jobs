# Iron and steel facilities in the U.S.

The following includes descriptions of iron and steel facilities in the U.S. 


### Data Sources

Global Energy Monitor (GEM): The dataset includes facility-level data for the iron and steel industry. This dataset includes information such as plant location, operating status, workforce size, ownership, process technology, and steel production capacity (thousand tonnes per annum, TTPA). The GEM dataset provides a more granular view of the industry, particularly for larger plants with capacities exceeding 0.5 million metric tonnes. The dataset including employment data is collected from publicly available sources like government reports, company filings, news articles, and regulatory filings. However, the dataset faces uncertainties due to variations in data sources, collection methods, reporting accuracy, timeliness, and regional differences. These factors necessitate cautious interpretation and cross-referencing with multiple sources for a more accurate understanding.

Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gases Tool (FLIGHT): The dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) supplements plant identification by providing additional information on emissions, fuel types, and locations of iron and steel mill plants. This data can offer insights into the environmental impact and energy consumption of these facilities.
